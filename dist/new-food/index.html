          <p>If you remember anything from your Northwestern tour, the words “Dining capital of the North Shore” might ring a bell. It may be hard to believe that this refers to Evanston, given the tragic goodbyes we said to Cheesie’s and Lyfe Kitchen last year. But it’s time to move on from mourning and embrace the new spots for munchies and mingling that have opened up across town.</p>



        <p class="section-hed">10Q Chicken</p>

          <p>The decor of 10Q is simple — metal tables and white walls are accentuated with a neon “10Q Chicken” sign and trendy letter board menus that look like they are asking to be featured on someone&#x27;s Instagram feed. But this simplicity is what gives 10Q a perfect college town vibe. The restaurant&#x27;s lofty acoustics make it the kind of place where you can talk and laugh in the company of close friends without worrying about being too loud or annoying to the people next to you. As its name suggests, 10Q&#x27;s menu is centered around chicken: panko tenders, flavorful bowls with meat and rice, sandwiches and wings. Most of these options are priced between $7 and $8, offering a competitively-priced alternative to the average meal at Chipotle. If you&#x27;re looking for a trendy treat, 10Q also serves matcha ice cream for less than $4.</p>

          <p>The first time I went to 10Q, I was slightly disappointed with the Katsu bowl I ordered. The bowl was filled with panko-fried chicken breast pieces, katsu aioli, white rice and greens, but the rice took up too much real estate in the bowl and the dish initially seemed bland. Drizzling the white aioli sauce made an ordinary dish feel more substantial, and the creamy sauce paired with the panko-crusted chicken created a new twist on comfort food. I visited again and got the Korean BBQ bowl, which features barbecue chicken and the same accoutrements as the Katsu bowl, and was pleasantly surprised by its unique kick of flavor. I preferred the Korean BBQ bowl to the Katsu, but the matcha soft-serve with Oreo powder was my favorite part.</p>


          <p>Falcon Eddy&#x27;s</p>


          <p>When I walked into Falcon Eddy’s Texas Barbeque, I was transported to a saloon in the Wild West. Cowboy boots and hats, American flags and a collection of patriotic posters decorate the space, and the red, white and blue color scheme creates a quintessentially American environment to complement the menu. Falcon Eddy’s offers sandwiches and plates of brisket, ribs, pork, chicken and sausage. Prices typically range from $9 to $12, but some entrees are significantly more expensive, and adding sides like mac and cheese, coleslaw and beans quickly adds up.</p>

          <p>I ordered the pulled chicken sandwich with a side of large fries. The sandwich was piled high with smoked chicken between two pillow-like Hawaiian style buns. There were several unique sauces on each table, and I doused the chicken with at least half of them to get a large sampling. My favorite was the Original Falcon Eddy’s BBQ sauce, because it gave the chicken a sweet and tempting burst of flavor – my mouth is watering just thinking about it. The fries were piping hot, layered with oregano, salt and a mix of other mysterious spices, and well worth the extra $4. My appetite was completely satisfied by the end of the meal — I got a great bang for my buck at Falcon Eddy&#x27;s.</p>


          <p>Soban Korea</p>


          <p>Just west of campus, situated by D&amp;D Finer Foods, is Soban Korea. The restaurant&#x27;s rustic brick walls, stained glass light fixtures and wooden, roomy booths create an atmosphere more formal than the other two spots I visited. Additionally, the comfortable booths provide an energy that is simultaneously relaxing and therapeutic; Soban Korea is perfect for rewarding yourself after a long week of classes. The menu offers appetizers like dumplings and small dishes of noodles, a comprehensive selection of soups, fried food, rice, barbecue and stir fry. Price-wise, almost everything is under $15.</p>

          <p>I ordered a “Refreshing Milk &amp; Yogurt Flavor” carbonated drink called Milkis to start the night, and then a chicken dolsot bibimbap and mandu gook soup. The bibimbap came in an audibly sizzling stone bowl and was filled with rice, vegetables, chicken and a fried egg. The savory and salty flavors in the bowl mingled perfectly and made every bite feel distinct yet complete. I wasn’t ready for how large the serving of mandu gook soup was, though. In a giant bowl of chicken broth, there were half a dozen beef dumplings, a cooked egg and green onions. I was full after eating a majority of the bibimbap and half of the steaming soup. The food comes in surprisingly large servings and is comforting as well as flavorful and substantial, making this my favorite spot out of the three restaurants I tried.</p>



        <p class="section-hed">What&#x27;s missing from Evanston&#x27;s food scene?</p>

          <p>“Places that are open late. Like, Insomnia and Burger King are the only places that are open late. Everything closes at like 9 p.m. When you’re studying you’re like ‘Wow, can’t go to get food! Gotta go to Sargent!’”</p>


          <p>– Britt Bommer, Weinberg sophomore</p>


          <p>“Evanston is missing some dank Hawaiian food. I’m from San Diego, so you got Hawaiian food all around. We need some spam musubis and, like, some barbecue chicken and some short ribs and stuff.&quot;</p>


          <p>– Brandon Kulik, Weinberg first-year</p>
